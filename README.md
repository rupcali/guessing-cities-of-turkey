# Turkey Cities Game

**Description:**

This Python project is a simple game that allows users to guess the names of cities in Turkey. The objective is to guess all 81 cities correctly.


**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library
- Pandas library


**Installation:**

1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TurkeyCitiesGame.git
   ```

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

3. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```


**Usage:**

1. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file in your Python environment:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. The game will display a map of Turkey with city markers.

3. Guess the names of the cities by entering them in the pop-up dialog that appears. Input "Çıkış" to exit the game.

4. The game will keep track of the correct guesses, and the user's progress will be displayed in the game window.

5. Once all 81 cities have been guessed or the user chooses to exit, a list of missing cities will be saved to a CSV file named `cities_to_learn.csv`.

**Additional Notes:**

- You can customize the game by modifying the source code, such as changing the map image, the way cities are displayed, or the exit keyword.

- To view the names of the cities in their respective positions, there is commented-out code in the script that you can uncomment and run to see the city names on the map.
